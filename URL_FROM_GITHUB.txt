or rename the file to download

curl -o do-bots.txt  https://www.digitalocean.com/robots.txt

or redirect

    curl -I www.digitalocean.com

The output shows that the URL was redirected. 
The first line of the output tells you that it 
was moved, and the Location line tells you where:

You could use curl to make another request manually, 
or you can use the --location or -L argument which 
tells curl to redo the request to the new location 
whenever it encounters a redirect. Give it a try:

    curl -L www.digitalocean.com/robots.txt
    
You can combine the -L argument with some of 
the aforementioned arguments to download the 
file to your local system:

    curl -L -o do-bots.txt www.digitalocean.com/robots.txt
